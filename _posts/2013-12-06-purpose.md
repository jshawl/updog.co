# /purpose/

Go ahead ask me.

>What's updog?

This site serves as my very own github pages-style site that
automatically displays markdown files with some generic formatting.

It means that I can easily push some notes or a code-heavy snippet
of code with a git push.

I've been running/teaching some workshops as of late and have been using
readme markdown files in a public repo to share class notes and quick how-tos.

## This is an example post

* A sample ul
  * That has list items
    * At many different level
      * Nesting gets tricky when you're this deep.
  * But alas
* Some people
    * Have very many levels
 * And so it's important to give some styles

1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three

This is some `inline code` that should be highlighted.

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo 'this is a block of code'
$ sudo rm -rf /*
$ # The command line is so cool
{% endhighlight %}

### Pretty cool, huh?!

I'm planning on maintaining private documents here. Posts that have

    private: true

...in the front matter will not be displayed on the home page, and are only viewable to those with a link, like
[this post](/private/).
